#Stock Market Price Prediction
Developed an LSTM-based deep learning model to predict stock prices using historical data. Implemented
data preprocessing, feature scaling, and time-series forecasting techniques to enhance accuracy. Applied
transfer learning and used visualization techniques to analyze stock trends and evaluate predictions.

Tools Used: LSTM, Sequential model, TensorFlow, Keras, Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization (Mat-
plotlib, Seaborn), Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebooks
